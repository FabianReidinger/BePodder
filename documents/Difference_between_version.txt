BePodder will be shareware, and in a very altruistic move by the team, they will donate 20% of the sales to Haiku, to support their development. Like BePodder's quality wasn't a good enough reason to buy it, you now have the added incentive of supporting Haiku through your purchase. The next beta stage will begin next week and a final version is expected around spring time. The main features include:

    * Easy to use yet powerful Graphical User Interface
    * Full integration with BFS
    * Integrated OPML Podcasts and Videoblog Directories
    * Built-in support for RSS 0.9, RSS 2.0 and iTunes
